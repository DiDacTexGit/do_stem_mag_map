There are growing concerns that the shipping industry is vulnerable to GPS spoofing (Lo (2019))\n\n\n\nGPS spoofing has the real risk of keeping ships at sea longer than necessary, or even causing ships to collide.\n These same concerns are amplified in the air industry where planes have the additional worry of being tricked into flying into dangerous no fly zones.\n\nGPS: Proceed for 10 more miles\n (Choksi (2016))"
