There are growing concerns that the shipping industry is vulnerable to GPS spoofing (Lo (2019))\n\n\n\nGPS spoofing has the real risk of keeping ships at sea longer than necessary, or even causing ships to collide.\n These same concerns are amplified in the aviation industry.

They simply record the number of pennies and wonder how this knowledge is useful in the real world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFew opportunities for students to see how scientists do experiments to make the world better.\n\nFew interactions with Scientist, especially in lower income brackets,\n\nOne needs role models to help one visualize that this career can be for them.\n\nDon’t see how one can make a living doing science."
