## GPS is not Always Reliable


<br> It is too easy for bad actors (aka Pirates) to spoof GPS signals to divert cargo ships or airplanes. There are growing concerns that the shipping industry is vulnerable to GPS spoofing (@shipGPSspoof)

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="54%"}
GPS spoofing has the real risk of keeping ships at sea longer than necessary, or even causing ships to collide.

<br> These same concerns are amplified in the aviation industry.
<br>
In addition, planes to worry about  being tricked into flying into dangerous no fly zones.

## Magnetic anomaly

The Earth's Magnetic Field has variations do to field locked in it's crust.

-   These fields change very slowly
    -   Geologic Timescale (\~20,000 year time scale)

## Why make another map

## Why make another map

<br>

<br>

Current maps are low resolution.

<br> Need higher resolutions for navigation

## Why Higher Resolutions

### Can you use this map to drive to the grocery store?

## How a Magnetic Maps are Made Now


:::{.columns}
::::{.column width=60%}
Maps are made using special equipped planes.

<br>
<br>


* It is a slow process and 
* Data needs to be cleaned to remove the <br>plane's magnetic field.

## How Far can a balloon go?

Pico balloons can circumnavigate the world several times

## Now Back to the STEM


## Why do Students have <br>low STEM interest

Many students do not see the value nor the purpose of a STEM education.  
<br>

### Why no interest? 

:::{.columns}
::::{.column width=78%}
* STEM activities tend to be focused on a single aspect of a scientific field. 
    * Students do not shout out Eureka after seeing how many pennies an aluminum boat can hold. They simply record the number of pennies and wonder how this knowledge is useful in the real world.
::::
::::{.column width=20%}
 ![](img/DALL-E_pennyBoat.png)
::::
:::
* Few opportunities for students to see how scientists do experiments to make the world better.   
* Few interactions with Scientist, especially in lower income brackets,
   *   One needs role models to help one visualize that this career can be for them. 
* Don't see how one can make a living doing science.  

## STEM Magnetic Mapping

This STEM project is designed to address these issues.  

<br>

It involves multiple fields of science and engineering:

:::{.columns}
::::{.column width=75%}
* Earth Science, 
* Physical Science and 
* Electrical and Mechanical Engineering 

Integrated into a single project for students grades eight through ten.  
::::
::::{.column width=20%}

::::
:::



<br>
It also rewards (via milestone achievements rewards: cash and/or prizes) for their work and their measurements supply scientists with information needed to make magnetic maps.  

<br>
Lastly, students are guided by college student mentors in a STEM field so that they can see people close to their age going into this field.
